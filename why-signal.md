# Why Signal

[Over 85% adults in the U.S. own a smartphone](https://www.statista.com/statistics/219865/percentage-of-us-adults-who-own-a-smartphone/), and most of those are going to be doing some kind of text-based messaging. SMS is popular because it works on almost all phones, and [other messaging apps have huge popularity](https://www.statista.com/statistics/258749/most-popular-global-mobile-messenger-apps/). Unfortunately, these all have major prviacy tradeoffs.

[Signal](https://signal.org) is a secure messaging application for iPhone, Android, and desktop. While previously only popular with journalists and nerds, it's gaining wider adoption. This is a good thing, and you should be using it, too. Here's why:

## Comparison of messaging options

Signal has a number of similarities with text messaging (SMS) and other messaging apps, but has some notable benefits. We'll go into more detail about some of them below.

{% include messaging-comparison.html %}

\*There are sometimes [issues with SMS group messages between Android and iPhone devices](https://forums.att.com/conversations/data-messaging-features-internet-tethering/group-texting-between-an-android-and-iphones/5deff166bad5f2f606258e7b).<br>
\*\*Limited reaction options

Unfortunately, there is no compatibility between them, so everyone you're talking to needs to be using the same thing for messaging: SMS can only talk to SMS, WhatsApp to WhatsApp, etc.

## Encryption

Without "end-to-end encryption", someone in between you and the person you're talking to can read your messages. Who might do such a thing?

### "I'm not important enough to be a target"

China, Russia, and other authoritarian countries are known for intercepting messages and using them to punish dissent. Unfortunately, it's not just them: Remember [Edward Snowden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden)? He exposed that [the American and British governments were doing widespread surveillance on the public](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden#Revelations), [including text messages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dishfire).

Have you ever sent a message or a picture that you'd be embarrassed if a stranger saw? Have you ever sent a message with any other [sensitive information](../#sensitive-information)? If so, you should be using encrypted messaging. Last Week Tonight did a segment that drives that point home:

<iframe class="youtube-embed" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XEVlyP4_11M?start=1494" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

**If you don't use encrypted messaging, you should assume that both the company and/or the government can see everything you send.** Even though [WhatsApp uses the same encryption Signal uses](https://www.whatsapp.com/security/), it still controls the app at either end and [shares data with Facebook](https://www.howtogeek.com/722911/is-whatsapp-end-to-end-encrypted-and-does-that-matter-for-privacy/).

This is obviously an even bigger deal for people like activists and victims of abuse. "Normal people" using Signal normalizes its use, which means people with even stronger needs for privacy can use it without that being a red flag.

## Open source

Software being "open source" means that the code is available for anyone to see. This is important for security, because it means an even broader range of security researchers can look through it for vulnerabilities, rather than just people in one company.

## Access to data

When you install WhatsApp, it all but [forces you to give your entire address book (phone numbers, emails, addresses, etc.) to Facebook](https://www.vice.com/en/article/qj4qjd/whatsapp-data-security-issues). If you're at all nervous about Big Tech, you should avoid using them. Signal is run by [a non-profit with a privacy-focused mission](https://signalfoundation.org/), and thus they do not have those bad incentives.

Even if you aren't worried about how those companies will use your data, them storing your messages means that they are a big target, which means hackers actively try to gain access to them.

[On Android, shady third party apps can ask for permission to access your text messages](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/important-smartphone-app-permissions/), and it's way too easy to click through and do so. They will be even more reckless than major tech companies in using that content, if not [actively malicious](https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/another-set-of-joker-trojan-laced.html). Even with using Signal, you need to be careful with apps you download and [the permissions you give them](https://www.avg.com/en/signal/guide-to-android-app-permissions-how-to-use-them-smartly).

## Conclusion

Signal is better than both SMS and other messaging apps for both [privacy and security](../#privacy-vs-security). I hope this has convinced you that you should be using Signal, no matter who you are.
