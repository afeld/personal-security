# Why Signal

[Signal](https://signal.org) is a messaging application for iPhone, Android, and desktop. While previously only popular with journalists and nerds, it's gaining wider adoption. This is a good thing, and you should be using it, too. Here's why:

## Comparison of messaging options

Signal has a number of similarities with text messaging (SMS) and other messaging apps, but has some notable benefits. We'll go into more detail about some of them below.

|                     Feature | SMS   | iMessage | WhatsApp | Facebook Messenger | Signal |
| --------------------------: | ----- | -------- | -------- | ------------------ | ------ |
| Works on Android and iPhone | Yes   | No       | Yes      | Yes                | Yes    |
|                      Groups | Yes\* | Yes      | Yes      | Yes                | Yes    |
|                     Replies | No    | No       | Yes      | No                 | Yes    |
|                   Reactions | No    | Yes\*\*  | Yes\*\*  | Yes\*\*            | Yes    |
|    [Encrypted](#encryption) | No    | Yes      | Yes      | No                 | Yes    |
| [Open source](#open-source) | No    | No       | No       | No                 | Yes    |

\*There are sometimes [issues with SMS group messages between Android and iPhone devices](https://forums.att.com/conversations/data-messaging-features-internet-tethering/group-texting-between-an-android-and-iphones/5deff166bad5f2f606258e7b).<br>
\*\*Limited reaction options

Unfortunately, there is no compatibility between them, so everyone you're talking to needs to be using the same thing for messaging: SMS can only talk to SMS, WhatsApp to WhatsApp, etc.

## Encryption

Without "end-to-end encryption", someone in between you and the person you're talking to can read your messages. Who might do such a thing?

### "I'm not important enough to be a target"

China, Russia, and other authoritarian countries are known for intercepting messages and using them to punish dissent. Unfortunately, it's not just them: Remember [Edward Snowden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden)? He exposed that [the American and British governments were doing widespread surveillance on the public](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden#Revelations), [including text messages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dishfire).

Have you ever sent a message or a picture that you'd be embarrassed if a stranger saw? If so, you should be using encrypted messaging. Last Week Tonight did a segment that drives that point home:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XEVlyP4_11M?start=1494" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

**If you don't use encrypted messaging, you should assume that both the company and/or the government can see everything you send.** Even though [WhatsApp uses the same encryption Signal uses](https://www.whatsapp.com/security/), it still controls the app at either end and [shares data with Facebook](https://www.howtogeek.com/722911/is-whatsapp-end-to-end-encrypted-and-does-that-matter-for-privacy/).

This is obviously an even bigger deal for people like activists and victims of abuse. "Normal people" using Signal normalizes its use, which means people with even stronger needs for privacy can use it without that being a red flag.

## Open source

Software being "open source" means that the code is available for anyone to see. This is important for security, because it means an even broader range of security researchers can look through it for vulnerabilities, rather than just people in one company.

## Access to data

Applications made by for-profit companies (WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, etc.) have access to your messages, and [can and do sell your data](TODO). When you install WhatsApp, it all but [forces you to give your entire address book (phone numbers, emails, addresses, etc.) to Facebook](https://www.vice.com/en/article/qj4qjd/whatsapp-data-security-issues). If you're at all nervous about Big Tech, you should avoid using them. Signal is run by [a non-profit with a privacy-focused mission](https://signalfoundation.org/), and thus they do not have those bad incentives.

[Both Android and iPhone allow arbitrary apps to access your text messages](TODO), and it's way too easy for a shady app to do so. They will be even more reckless than major tech companies in using that content. [Example.](TODO)

## Conclusion

Signal is better than both SMS and other messaging apps for both [privacy and security](../#privacy-vs-security). I hope this has convinced you that you should be using Signal, no matter who you are.
