# {{ site.title }} - next steps

These tips require a bit more commitment or technical comfort, but are worth the effort.

## Messaging

- [ ] **Use a [messaging app with end-to-end encryption](why-signal#comparison-of-messaging-options)** (E2EE).

For more information, see the [Freedom of the Press Foundation's Secure Communication guide](https://freedom.press/training/secure-communication/).

## Accounts

- [ ] [**Google: Go through their Privacy Checkup.**](https://myaccount.google.com/intro/privacycheckup)
- **Meta (Facebook, Instagram, etc.):** Go through their:
  - [ ] [**Privacy Checkup**](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/checkup/)
  - [ ] [**Ad preferences**](https://accountscenter.facebook.com/ads)
- [ ] **Try [Privacy Party](https://www.blockpartyapp.com/privacy-party/).**

## Sensitive information

Examples of sensitive information:

- Credit card numbers
- Passwords
- Social security numbers
- Photos or messages you don't want other people to see

### Who to share it with

**If someone contacts you via phone or email and asks for sensitive information, don't give it to them.** This often comes up as fake customer support or debt collectors. If this happens and you think it _might_ be legitimate, follow up via official channels (the customer service number on the back of your credit card, etc.)

### How to send

**Don't share sensitive information in SMS or (unencrypted) email directly.** See more info for [Gmail](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6330403) and [Outlook](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/encrypt-email-messages-373339cb-bf1a-4509-b296-802a39d801dc). An easy alternative is putting the information in a file/document in Google Drive / Dropbox / etc. and sharing that.

## Personal information

[Your personal information is constantly being sold by data brokers.](https://privacy.com/blog/what-are-data-brokers)

- [ ] **Sign up for [a data removal service](https://restoreprivacy.com/data-removal/best-data-removal-services/)** to get your information automatically removed from people-search sites.

### Leaks

Your personal/contact information, passwords, etc. may have become available to people that shouldn't have it.

- [ ] **Sign up for data breach alerts** through one of the following services:
  - [1Password Watchtower](https://watchtower.1password.com/)
  - [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) notifications
    - Can do a one-time check without signing up
  - [Mozilla Monitor](https://monitor.mozilla.org/)

## Passwords

- [ ] **Use different ([strong](#passwords)) passwords for every service.**
  - If you use the same password across services, one service getting hacked means your accounts with other services could be compromised. This happens [all the time](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/07/29/technology/personaltech/what-parts-of-your-information-have-been-exposed-to-hackers-quiz.html?_r=0).
  - The best way to do this is with a [password manager](#password-manager).

### Password manager

- [ ] **Set up a password manager.**

A password manager solves a number of problems:

- You don't have to remember all of your different passwords for different services.
- Your list of passwords can't be stolen as easily as if they are written on paper, a Word document, or a spreadsheet.
- Most can generate a random, non-trivial password.
  - This often means you won't know your own password for a given service...which is not a bad thing!

It's worth paying for one of [**the top-recommended options**](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-password-managers/), but if you're cost-conscious or want minimal hassle, you can use one that comes built into your browser:

- [Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/edit-your-passwords-in-microsoft-edge-38ef988f-5a65-4c6a-9db8-937995d3ae31)
- [Firefox Password Manager](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/password-manager-remember-delete-change-and-import)
- [Google (Chrome) Password Manager](https://passwords.google/)
- [Safari](https://support.apple.com/en-us/105115)

## Devices

Do these for all of your computers, phones, tablets, etc.

- [ ] [**Go through the Wirecutter Secure Your Smartphone guide.**](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/guides/online-security-secure-your-smartphone/)
- [ ] **Enable full disk encryption.**
  - Back up your system first
  - Computer
    - Windows: [BitLocker](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/turn-on-device-encryption-0c453637-bc88-5f74-5105-741561aae838)
    - Mac: [FileVault](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204837)
  - Phone
    - [Android](https://www.howtogeek.com/141953/how-to-encrypt-your-android-phone-and-why-you-might-want-to/)
    - iOS: just set a password
- [ ] [**iOS/Mac: Review your personalized ads setting.**](https://support.apple.com/en-us/105131)
- [ ] [**iOS: Go through the built-in privacy and security protections page.**](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/use-built-in-privacy-and-security-protections-iph6e7d349d1/ios)
  - [ ] [**iOS: Review app tracking permissions.**](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/control-app-tracking-permissions-iph4f4cbd242/ios)

## Payments

- **When paying in-person using a credit or debit card, use the chip or contactless/tap-to-pay** instead of swiping.
- **[Use disposable/one-time/virtual credit card numbers](https://www.doctorofcredit.com/list-of-banks-which-offer-virtual-account-numbers/) for payments**, especially if you are wary of the vendor.
- **Make online payments through PayPal or another trusted service** instead of entering your payment information into a third-party site directly.
- **Don't let vendors store your credit card details.**
  - Many will have an option like "save for later" — don't check that box.

## Credit

- [ ] **[Freeze your credit.](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/credit-score/pros-and-cons-of-freezing-credit/)**

## Networking

- [ ] **Make sure there is a password on your wifi network.** If you like having an open network, you can buy a router with a built-in public hotspot.
- [ ] **Set up [DNS over HTTPS](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-over-tls/).**
  - This can cause issues when you're on some networks, like in a [corporate office](https://superuser.com/questions/721725/why-cant-i-use-custom-dns-server-addresses-in-a-network) or on [airplane WiFi](https://nullthoughts.com/tech/2019/08/09/inflight-wifi-not-working-due-to-custom-dns-servers/). You may need to disable now and then.
- [ ] [**Check for upgrades to your router firmware.**](https://www.wikihow.com/Update-Router-Firmware)
