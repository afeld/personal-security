# {{ site.title }}

This is a guide for individuals who are interested in improving their digital security/privacy. Only basic knowledge of how to use your computer and mobile device is required.

## Low-hanging fruit

  - [ ] [Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/messages/get-sms-mms-and-rcs-texts-from-iphone-icht8a28bb9a/mac)

### Important accounts

Prioritize securing services that you frequently use for communication, or that have sensitive information like your contacts, financial, payment, or health information. In other words, which accounts do you have that, if hacked, would be a Big Deal? Examples of services that might be at the top of that list:

- Bank(s)
- Ecommerce
- Email
- Social media

We'll refer to this in subsequent sections.

#### Security Checkups

Some services have a built-in Security Checkup tools, walking you through various account settings. **Go through them for:**

- [ ] [**Google**](https://myaccount.google.com/intro/security-checkup)
  - [ ] [**Review My Google Activity.**](https://myactivity.google.com/) Are you ok with Google knowing all of that about you?
  - [ ] [**Remove the Results About You**](https://myactivity.google.com/results-about-you)
- [ ] [**Meta (Facebook, Instagram, etc.)**](https://accountscenter.facebook.com/password_and_security)

### Passwords

- [ ] **Set [strong passwords](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-and-use-strong-passwords-c5cebb49-8c53-4f5e-2bc4-fe357ca048eb)** on all of your [important accounts](#important-accounts) and [devices](#devices).
  - Otherwise, hackers can get into your account(s) extremely easily. Different services have different requirements around passwords.
  - This is easier if you [set up a password manager](next-steps/#password-manager).

### [Multi-factor authentication](https://brainstation.io/cybersecurity/two-factor-auth)

- [ ] **Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) on all of your [important accounts](#important-accounts).**

Also known as two-factor authentication (2FA). [All major services offer MFA.](https://2fa.directory/)

When enabling MFA, using one or more of the following is recommended:

- Biometrics ([Apple Face ID](https://support.apple.com/en-us/108411), fingerprint, etc.)
- An app to generate codes that synchronizes:
  - [1Password](https://support.1password.com/one-time-passwords/) - paid, but is a full-fledged [password manager](next-steps/#password-manager)
  - [Authy](https://www.authy.com/) - free
  - [Google Authenticator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447) - free
- The service's app, when it supports push notification for MFA. For example:
  - [Apple ID](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102660)
  - [Google](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/7026266)
- Text messages (SMS)

## Next steps

Great work! Your personal security and privacy are now _waaaay_ above average.

Eager/willing to do more?

## Privacy vs. security

In short, security is like having bars on your windows: hackers can't get in, but they can see through. Privacy is like having blinds, where they can't see in, but they can reach their hand in and unlock the door. You'll need a combination of protections to address both.
